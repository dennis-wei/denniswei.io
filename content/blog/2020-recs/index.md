description: The things that kept me going through this shit year
---

The silver lining of this awful year for has been that I have had a lot more time to read, watch movies, listen to music, catch up on video games, and all other sorts of cultural consumption. Here's a brief list of my favorite releases of 2020.

If you wish to instead read a more narrative timeline of pieces I thought were particularly indicative of my 2020 experience, check it out [here](/blog/2020-timeline).

### Books

**Transcendent Kingdom - Yaa Gyasi**

An introspective look at addiction, family, and the intertwining of science and religion. Gyasi demonstrates a massive range by creating a more individually focused narrative that is good as her debut epic *Homegoing*.

**Vesper Flights - Helen Macdonald**

A brilliant collection of essays highlighting mystical natural phenomena and how wildlife can be used as a lens into human nature.

**Writers & Lovers - Lily King**

A coming-of-age story for the precarious and untethered millennial that explores infidelity, love, and labor through the eyes of a young writer. An A24 film in novel form.

**Minor Feelings - Cathy Park Hong**

The most nuanced examination of the particulars of being Asian American I've read in a long time full of novel conceptual definitions and intriguing characters.

### Video Games

**Hades - Supergiant Games**

An incredibly polished 2D action rogue-lite with crisp controls, huge run variety, and lots of small nudges that make each run feel fair yet unique.

**Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo**

A video game full of chores that somehow become fun when presented with a layer of cute animal avatars. The latest iteration is by far the most customizable and is perfect for socially distanced socialization.

**Cyberpunk 2077 - CD Projekt Red**

Contrary to a lot of press, Cyberpunk 2077 is full of immersive storytelling, well-designed RPG mechanics, and often hilarious bugs. There are smart little polished details around every corner if you actively seek them out. Played on Stadia.

**The Last of Us: Part 2 - Naughty Dog**

A genuine advancement in the realm of interactive storytelling through narrative structure. The morals and themes are a bit bluntly handled, but the emotional journey is well worth it if you're willing to let plot holes slide. The gameplay is effectively a more polished version of the already brilliantly immersive mechanics of the original game.

### Music

**How I'm Feeling Now - Charli XCX**

Charli continues a trend of excellence with yet another collection with clean production, relatable lyrics, and dance-worthy hooks.

**I Disagree - Poppy**

A profound transformation for former Youtube star Poppy which merges brilliant nu-metal lines with the catchy pop melodies we've already known Poppy capable of. The hyperpop version of a rock opera.

**Sawayama - Rina Sawayama**

Hyper-focused hyperpop which combines a vast array of genres and messages through tight production.

**Punisher - Phoebe Bridgers**

If Phoebe keeps putting out music of this quality, Pharbz will one day outnumber kpop stans. And shoutout to the Iris cover she did with Maggie Rogers.

### Films

**Birds of Prey - Cathy Yan**

A superhero movie that is willing to just have fun and not get caught up in the details of creating ultra-dramatic plotlines with world-ending stakes.

**Black Bear - Lawrence Michael Levine**

A welcome entry to the club of media that, for structural reasons, cannot be spoiled at all without ruining the experience.

**Never Rarely Sometime Always - Eliza Hittman**

An emotionally charged narrative of a teenager who travels to New York to get an abortion. Some of the best young acting I've seen in a long time powered by a screenplay that provides just the right amount of framing around incredibly sensitive topics.
